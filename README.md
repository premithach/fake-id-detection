This repository contains a Python project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect tampering in PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards. The project leverages image processing, thresholding, and difference calculations to identify any alterations or modifications in the provided PAN card images.
## Features
Image Thresholding: Apply thresholding techniques to convert images into binary representations, enhancing the visibility of differences between the original and tampered images.
